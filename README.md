# Cybersecurity Internship ‚Äì Phase 3: Advanced Threat Hunting & APT Simulation

## üìåOverview

This phase focuses on simulating Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) techniques and applying threat hunting methodologies to detect, analyze, and respond to sophisticated cyber attacks. It is the final phase of a 3-part internship and showcases advanced knowledge of adversarial emulation, endpoint logging, and incident detection.
